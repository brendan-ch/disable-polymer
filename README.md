# Disable Polymer

A simple Chrome extension that lets you restore the old classic YouTube layout.

## Why?

The polymer redesign of YouTube takes up more resources than the classic one, which impacts performance on lower-end machines. This extension sets the `disable_polymer` parameter to `1` when navigating to YouTube, effectively restoring the classic design.

## Installation

For now you'll need to download the source code and load it as an unpacked extension.
1. Download the [source code](https://github.com/unnameduser95/disable-polymer/archive/master.zip) and unzip it.
2. Go to chrome://extensions.
3. On the top right corner of the page, make sure Developer Mode is turned on.
4. Click on "Load unpacked" and choose the directory with the source code.
